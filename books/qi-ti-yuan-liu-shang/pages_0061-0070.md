# The Profound Meaning of Constant Tranquility

## The Eight Thieves and the Ten Losses

All people in this world are harmed by these six thieves, seven emotions, and ten losses. I advise all good people to eliminate these six thieves, seven emotions, and ten losses completely, return to the right path, and never board the ship of thieves, lest they fall into the abyss and regret it later.

The Poem of Wuxin Daoren (Daoist) says:

> The eyes do not observe colors, the nose does not smell fragrances.  
> With a sincere and righteous mind, one preserves the true nature.  
> The three realms are empty, there is nothing.  
> No birth, no death, the lifespan is eternal.

The Poem of Yin Zhenren (Daoist) says:

> The spiritual light shines on the River Ganges day and night.  
> Saints and mortals originally share the same family.  
> When the mind is free from thoughts, the whole being manifests.  
> As soon as the six senses move, they are obscured by clouds.

## Chapter 8: The Three Corpses

One can expel desires and the mind will naturally become tranquil. Clarify the mind and the spirit will naturally become pure. Then the six desires will not arise, and the three poisons will be eliminated.

The Three Corpses

Upper Corpse: Peng Ju  
Controls the upper part of the body, good and evil

Middle Corpse: Peng Zhi  
Controls the middle part of the body, good and evil  

Lower Corpse: Peng Jue  
Controls the lower part of the body, good and evil

The Upper Corpse resides in the Jade Pillow Acupoint, the Middle Corpse resides in the Intersecting Spine Acupoint, and the Lower Corpse resides in the Coccyx Acupoint. On the days of Gengzi and Jiazi, they report on good and evil. There are also nine worms that harm deeply, blocking the three passes and nine openings, preventing the true yang from ascending. These nine worms have names:

1. Submissive Worm, residing in the Jade Pillow Orifice
2. Dragon Worm, residing in the Celestial Pillar Orifice
3. White Worm, residing in the Ceramic Path Orifice
4. Flesh Worm, residing in the Spirit Path Orifice
5. Red Worm, residing in the Intersecting Spine Orifice
6. Barrier Worm, residing in the Mysterious Pivot Orifice
7. Lung Worm, residing in the Gate of Life Orifice
8. Stomach Worm, residing in the Dragon and Tiger Orifice
9. Sloughing Worm, residing in the Coccyx Orifice

The Three Corpses reside in the three passes, and the nine worms reside in the nine openings, transforming and concealing, their movements undetectable. They transform beautiful forms, cause wet dreams, and create illusory scenes that induce delusions, making the great Dao difficult to accomplish.

Therefore, the Cinnabar Classic says: "The Three Corpses and Nine Worms are in the human body, blocking the Yellow River with deep poisonous气." If cultivators do not know the method to slay the Three Corpses and eliminate the Nine Worms, they should quickly seek a wise teacher, humbly ask for guidance on the great Dao, and request Sun Wukong from the Dragon Palace in the East Sea to bring the golden cudgel to open the three passes and three caves. Then the Nine Worms will be eliminated, and longevity will be attained.

The Poem of Wugu Zi says:

> The seven emotions and six desires are like dust.  
> In one night, the heavy rain washes the impurities anew.  
> Awaiting the first thunder to be triggered,  
> The howling of the corpses and ghosts is terrifying.

The Poem of Bodhidharma says:

> When the positive energy is aroused, use diligence.  
> The Nine Worms and Three Corpses should be expelled.  
> When entering the battlefield, be very careful,  
> Lest you fall into the depths of Lake Dongting.

## The Explanation of Constant Tranquility by the Highest Venerable Lord, Chapter 9: On Temperament

The reason one cannot [expel desires] is that the mind is not yet clarified, and desires are not yet expelled.

The mind is not yet clarified, and desires are not yet expelled. This is an inability to sweep away the three minds and four appearances.

"The mind is not yet clarified" means this person's mind is not yet dead.
"Desires are not yet expelled" means the seven emotions and six desires have not yet departed.
Therefore, they cannot become immortal, become a Buddha, become a sage, or become a worthy. 

Why is this so? It is clear that they cannot let go of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.

If one can truly let go of the emotion of joy and transform it into original nature, let go of the emotion of anger and transform it into original emotion, let go of the emotion of happiness and transform it into original spirit, let go of the emotion of sorrow and transform it into original essence, and let go of desires and transform them into the five elements, what immortal could one not become? What Buddha could one not attain?

The Confucians say: "Be cautious of what you do not see, be fearful of what you do not hear." The Buddhists say: "No eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind. No color, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma." The Daoists say: "Indistinct, indistinct, dark, dark." If one follows the practices of the Three Teachings' sages and saints, what private matter could one not let go of? What desire could one not expel?

The sages of the Three Teachings all teach people to let go of their private desires, for private desires belong to the yin. The sages of the Three Teachings all teach people to preserve their heavenly principles, for heavenly principles belong to the yang.

## The Explanation of Constant Tranquility by the Highest Venerable Lord, Chapter 10: On Emptiness

Ones who can expel [desires] observe their mind inwardly, finding the mind to be without mind. They observe their form outwardly, finding the form to be without form. They observe objects from afar, finding objects to be without objects. 

The three having been realized, only emptiness is seen.

To expel [desires] is to drive away all distracting thoughts to other realms. To observe the mind inwardly is to close the eyes and look within. "The mind is without mind" means that thoughts arise from the mind, but the mind itself is gone. See where the thoughts come from. 

To observe the form outwardly is to close the eyes and look outside. "The form is without form" means that the mind arises from the form, but the form itself is gone. See where the mind comes from.

To observe objects from afar is to close the eyes and look far into the heavens, earth, sun, moon, and stars - all are gone. See where the body comes from.

The three having been realized, it means that the mind, body, and objects all seem to be gone. "Only emptiness is seen" means that the Three Realms of heaven, earth, and humanity, and the myriad things, do not have a single thing. It is a dark, obscure void. Only eternal emptiness remains unresolved.

Space is without space. Nonbeing is also without nonbeing. Stillness is without stillness.

Space is without space. Nonbeing is also without nonbeing. Stillness is without stillness.
