# Playful Chapter

## The Profound and Mysterious Chapter

The Great Way has no form, so it contains all forms within it. Nurturing its formlessness, the form constantly exists. The true nature is non-doing, so externally it does not give rise to the mind. With no mind to use, the mind constantly exists. As it is, so naturally, it is boundless. With no doing, there is nothing that is not penetrated. Forgetting the object when confronting it, one does not sink into the demon of the six thieves. I do not chase the objects, and the objects do not interfere with me. Residing in the dust, yet emerging from the dust, I do not fall into the transformations of myriad conditions. I do not establish the dust, and the dust does not stain me. Achieving stillness without moving, this is great tranquility. Achieving harmony without changing, this is great wisdom. Wisdom illuminates the ten directions, this is great clarity. Emptiness transforms with no-doing, this is great penetration.

This is the Profound and Mysterious Chapter. It clarifies the principle of the Way. Therefore, it is followed by the Chapter on the Mysterious Principle. The "Piercing the Antiquity Scripture" says: "Nurturing its formlessness, the form constantly exists," which is the meaning of the Great Way having no form. Mencius said: "Not doing, there is nothing that is not done," which is the meaning of the true nature being non-doing. Internally without form, it is so naturally. Externally without doing, it is complete and abundant. The Patriarch said: "The elixir field has a treasure, do not ask about the Dao. When facing objects, the mind is empty, do not ask about Zen." This is the same meaning. Forgetting the object when confronting it, what demon is there? Residing in the dust, yet emerging from the dust, what condition is there? When the condition ceases, the nature becomes still. When the demon ceases, the mind becomes harmonious. Achieving stillness, it does not move. Achieving harmony, it does not change. Holding the two principles together, the round clarity universally illuminates, the spiritual transformation is boundless.

The verse says: There is law, awaken to the lawless. The mind follows the law and is born, the law follows the mind and is extinguished. There is cultivation, there is no cultivation. The nature originally has no cultivation, cultivation is not the nature. It embraces the myriad forms as its body, the mind is empty, the nature is still, it contains nothing. It does not cling to a single strand of hair. As soon as it is stained by a speck of dust, it becomes leaky.

This verse speaks of its substance and function. In its substance, it is empty. In its function, it is present. Therefore, it can suddenly awaken to the lawless from the law. Because there is no cultivation, it breaks through the cultivation. As for not establishing being and non-being, the mind and the law are both forgotten, the substance is the same as the great void, it encompasses without limit, the principle of the Great Way is exhausted here.

## Commentary on the Five Kitchen Scriptures by Laozi

I have heard that the Book of Changes says: "Refine the meaning and enter the spiritual, to put it into use; use it to secure one's person, to honor virtue." How rich are these words! How rich are these words! This means that the meaning must be refined before it can be used to enter the spiritual and put into use, the use must be beneficial before it can be used to secure one's person and honor virtue. One who claims to put it into use without refining the meaning, or claims to secure one's person without beneficial use, has never existed.

Therefore, the simple use is the master of creation and transformation. Refined qi becomes things, called the blended and tranquil, vague and continuous, there is establishment and standing. Then does not the great virtue of heaven and earth say "to give life"? Those who completely preserve their form and give life, it is in having few thoughts and desires, embracing the uncarved block and seeking harmony, dwelling in the bland, merging the qi in the vague, and the purity and clarity are in the person, the will and energy are like the spirit, when the desires are about to arise, there must first be an opening. Therefore, the sages hang education to restrain it, expand the businesses to maintain it, focus the qi to make it soft to guide its harmony, turn to the dark and quiet to stop its desires. Wash the heart and hide the secret, exhausting the spirit to know the transformation? Then the person can be secured and the country can be protected, the virtue and use are such that the people do not know, thus the heavens assist it, and there is no misfortune that is not auspicious. I have read through the five chapters of this scripture, it completely covers the essentials of cultivating the person and guarding the life, the complete harmony and oneness, the refined meaning can enter the spirit, sitting in forgetfulness and illuminating, securing the person can honor virtue, reflecting on it for a long time, I occasionally make annotations. I, the humble and lowly servant, am deeply graced, the heavenly light does not abandon, forgetting my vulgarity, I bow in shame, hesitating and lost, I kneel and kneel, I speak carefully.

## Commentary on the Five Kitchen Scriptures by Laozi

Now, preserving the harmonious and peaceful qi, the five viscera are filled, the five spirits are correct. When the five viscera are full, the flavors are sufficient, when the five spirits are correct, the desires are eliminated. This scripture is what the five viscera receive, like seeking food in the kitchen, hence it is called the Five Kitchens.

The harmonious and peaceful qi, the qi refers to the wondrous fundamental simplicity and use, called the original qi. The use is yang harmony in heaven, yin harmony on earth, the blending and merging is peaceful harmony. Therefore, in human birth, they all rely on the harmony of this qi to become the peaceful harmony, and then the physical form is complete and the five constant virtues function. Therefore, Laozi said: "The myriad things carry the yin and embrace the yang, blending the qi to make the harmony." Therefore, the one who preserves the fundamental should externally cut off the two receptions, to complete the life division, internally preserve the one qi, to make the peaceful harmony, the one qi is harmonious and the nature and life are complete.

Therefore, Laozi said: "Focusing the qi to make it soft, can you be like the infant?"

Obtaining the one is all peaceful.

Obtaining the one means, internally preserving the one qi to nourish the essence and spirit, externally completing the physical form to dwell in the peaceful. Thus the one qi is simple and used, harmonious with the peaceful harmony in the body, hence it is called obtaining the one. In this way, the way of cultivating life and nourishing the spirit all accords with the peaceful harmony. Therefore, Laozi said: "The myriad things obtain the one to give life."

Harmony is no one harmony,

This means that when a person first receives the one qi, to make the peaceful harmony, if they preserve the harmony and obtain the one, then the principle of harmony is all peaceful, when the great harmony is open, not only is there no one, there is also no harmony, it cannot be investigated, like the earth lying flat. Therefore, Laozi said: "I do not know its name."

The mysterious principle is the same as the mysterious realm.

Mysterious means wondrous. Principle means nature. This says that the one qi resides in the mysterious realm of harmony, the principle arises from its nature, the nature cultivates the return to virtue, and the wondrous opens in the harmony, when the wondrous nature is harmonious, it is the same as the mysterious in the realm. Therefore, Laozi said: "The same is called mysterious."

Not thinking with the mind,

Mind means imagination and love. This means that in preserving the one qi to make the peaceful harmony, one must be careful not to preserve the imagined reception, to condition the object consciousness, but should focus the spirit in clear observation, making it vague and empty, so that the harmony is open before the arising of thought, the wisdom arises after the forgetting of knowledge, looking at that emptiness, then the auspicious will stop. If one thinks with the mind, imagining the reception of dust, it causes the burning of the harmony, how can the white be produced? Therefore, Laozi said: "Seal its passage, close its doors, throughout life do not labor."

Nor seek non-thinking.

Just do not condition the imagined reception, then the illuminating wisdom will naturally arise, the arising of the illuminating wisdom also does not know itself, if one knows to seek non-thinking, it already involves the imagined reception, no different from that thinking with the mind. Therefore, Laozi said: "The nameless uncarved block, it too will not desire."

The mind without thinking,

Internally preserving the one qi, just let it be empty, the empty then descends the harmony, the principle of harmony naturally opens, although not conditioning the imagined reception of the harmony, forcibly assuming a mental name, since it is not the object consciousness that is preserved, therefore it has no thinking.  Laozi said: "Use its light, return to its clarity."

This method is thus preserved.

As such, internally preserving the peaceful harmony, the law of the peaceful harmony is open, then this method is all abandoned, abandoning the law without abiding, what else is there to preserve, using non-preservation as the preservation, hence it is said "this method is thus preserved."

Do not let the mind condition the mind,

The mind is the substance of wisdom, the vessel of imagination and reception. Correct reception then gives rise to wisdom, deviant reception then gives rise to imagination. If one can harmonize the qi within, the mind is correct within, the internal observation is pure and clear, then the correct wisdom is tranquil and illuminating, reflecting the clarity without any dust rising, deep and still with all phenomena seen. Seeing phenomena without a master, this is called the constant mind. If one uses the mind to obtain the mind, conditions the mind to receive defilement, externally there are various dharmas, internally without the illuminating observation, the constant mind is already lost, then the principle of harmony is also deficient. Therefore, Zhuangzi said: "Obtain its mind, with its mind, obtain its constant mind, what thing is most valuable?"

Still do not abide in the severing of conditions.

If one conditions the mind with the mind, then one receives various receptions, if the correct reception gives rise to wisdom, one obtains the constant mind, when the wisdom mind is constant, then in the correct there is no reception, what condition is there? Since there is no conditioning mind, there is also no conditioning of the severing, tranquil and ever still, what is there to abide in? Laozi said: "Lose it again and again, until reaching non-doing."

When the mind is, do not preserve the mind,

The illuminating clarity is ever constant, then it is called the mind existing, at the severing there is no going, therefore it is said do not preserve the illuminating observation, since one does not take and follow the mind to condition, then there is no severing and no abiding.

Truly, guard the true depth.

True means the constant mind of illuminating clarity, pure and uncontaminated. If one sinks into that source of wisdom, still without any defilement, already without knowing the dharma, also without conditioning the mind, then the peaceful harmony contains the true, originally not separated, hence it is said to guard it.

Cultivate the principle, detach from the will,

Principle means nature, will means the mind has something it focuses on. If one severs the reception of external objects with this mind, then it is the nature receiving. This says that in cultivating the nature, the mind has something it focuses on, but obtain the pervasive illumination, if the external dust is already severed, the object consciousness has no focus, detach from form and leave knowledge, merge with the great penetration, the nature returns to the beginning, the round illumination without obstruction, the internal and external are both pure, the mysterious within the mysterious, then one is detached from the imagined focus.

Accumulated cultivation does not conform to detachment.

The above says to cultivate the nature and detach the will, then the internal and external are both still, without arising abiding mind, also without empty mind, sitting in forgetfulness, walking in forgetfulness, if one accumulates and cultivates, unable to forget and extinguish, the one thought of cultivation, it leads to a thousand catties, the internal illumination is already shaken, the external dust all arises, then it does not conform to that detachment of the will.

Will but do not cultivate the will,

If the mind has nothing to focus on, then how can one gradually awaken, it must be because of the focus that one obtains the settled mind, hence it is called the will. Not cultivating the will means, clearly detach from the will and do not accumulate cultivation, forgetting cultivation and then the nature is settled, then stillness and round illumination.

One's own work without self-knowledge.

Because the mind's focus makes the wisdom work pure, hence it is called one's own work. Internally forgetting the self, externally forgetting the things, in the illuminating observation the self has not a speck of use, then one's own work is without self-knowledge.

The various foods congeal the qi,

Now, the one qi congealing and coagulating, to make the peaceful harmony, the one is all peaceful. But now, taking in the flavors through the mouth, to fill the five viscera, the body gathers foams and bubbles, relying on them as form, condensing the moisture in water, taking the heat from fire, depending on the breath of wind, the four conditions coagulate the leaks, all are not the wondrous substance, therefore finely extinguishing the one qi, obscuring and muddying the peaceful harmony, causing the arising of imaginative reception which is the harm of its mechanism.

Not the long settled coagulation.

This means that people should make the peaceful harmony, contain the one without any imagined reception, guard the true ever tranquil. But now using the various foods to congeal the qi, therefore it is not the long settled coagulation.

The qi returns to its original qi,

The four conditions receive consciousness, the six defilements give rise to harm, earth, water, fire, wind, scattered and returning to the root, when the root consciousness is already defiled, then it follows the karmic work it received.

Following the taking, take the dissipation.

Taking means receiving and taking in. Dissipation means manifesting the use. Now, there are two receptions of imagination, two resultant karmas, following what is received and taken in, the use manifests its signs. If the peaceful harmony is harmonious, then the one qi is completely harmonious, reaching that emptiness, this is called returning the life, returning the life obtains the constant, this is called the name of correct reception, the correct reception purifies the karma, able to give rise to illuminating observation, the illuminating observation ever tranquil, with nothing, then it enters the uninterrupted. The one, then the food qi returns to the four conditions, the karma is complete and then it sinks into the six realms.

Now it is said that in the use, eating and drinking is settled, prohibit the mouth and sit alone, do not arise a single thought. Forget all affairs, preserve the spirit and settle the mind, the lips adhere, the teeth connect, the eyes do not see things, the ears do not hear sounds, guarding one mind within, adjust the breath continuously. Lightly exhale, as if there is and as if there is not, do not let it be interrupted, naturally the fire of the mind descends, the water of the kidneys ascends, the saliva is self-generated in the mouth, the numinous true is embodied, self-knowing the path of longevity. In the twelve hours, always maintain purity. The spirit platform having nothing is called pure, a single thought not arising is called stillness. The body is the dwelling of qi, the mind is the abode of spirit. When the intention acts, the spirit acts, when the spirit acts, the qi gathers. The true qi of the five phases, congeals into a knife-edge, naturally there are sounds in the body, in walking, sitting, and lying, one constantly feels the body like the movement of wind, the abdomen like the rumbling of thunder, the open and harmonious qi penetrates, the sweet dew pours on the head, self-drinking the knife-edge.
